# Project Overview
### **CC iDTC x BE.Center Survey Sprint**

---

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.


Two areas of focus: End consumers and key influencers (not just in social media terms)

#### **Goal**
One quick survey to rule them all. The topics covered will be:

**Exploratory**:
* EV rental behavior/beliefs
* Climate and social media reputation
* Food - Waste
* Food - Plant-based Diets

**Comparisons**: 
* EV rental metrics vs EV purchasing metrics
* Community solar metrics vs Green energy metrics
